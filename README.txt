If you want to use Eclipse:
	~ open the folder named "SWE642HW" as a new Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse
	~ set it up with your tomcat server
	~ you should just be able to run it on your server

If you want to use the war file:
	~ paste the war file in the "webapps" folder of apache tomcat

If the war file doesn't work & you don't want to use Eclipse:
	~ paste the folder named "SWE642HW" into the "wtpwebapps" folder of apache tomcat
	~ add "/SWE642HW" to the end of your url

Enjoy!
